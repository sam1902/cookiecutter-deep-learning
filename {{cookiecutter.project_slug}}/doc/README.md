# Documentation

## Directories

 - `notebooks` contains the notebooks used during the initial research phase. Those are not required to work or be commited at every change and are only there to provide a sparse history of what direction did the research go.
 - `graphs` contains performance plots and comparisons of different state of the arts implementation on meaningful metrics.
 - `papers` contains the publications proposing the approaches that have been implemented or compared for this project.
 - `results` contains the images, or screenshots of the results produced by the implemented models. Those may be linked into the main README with `![alt](doc/results/image.png)`.
